## Concepts Used

* Encapsulation: Protecting student data using private attributes.
* Inheritance: Different entities (Student, Instructor, etc.) could extend a base Person class.
* Polymorphism: Methods for displaying data or calculating results behave differently depending on class.
* Abstraction: Simplifies grade calculations and course operations through well-defined methods.

## Technologies

* Java SE (Console-based)
* Uses standard Java collections and OOP concepts

## How to Run

Compile the project:
* javac Main.java
* Run the program:
* java Main

## Purpose

This project was designed to manage educational data efficiently and demonstrate OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction in practice.
